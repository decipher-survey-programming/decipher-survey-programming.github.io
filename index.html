    <h1>Q. Who are the Github organization owners?</h1>
    <p>A. Brad and hopefully Shaen and Jeremy. We can consider adding more, but I'd prefer to keep the group small.</p>
  
    <h1>Q. Who can contribute?</h1>
    <p>A. Anyone via pull requests</p>
  
    <h1>Q. Can we create new repos?</h1>
    <p>A. Yes</p>
    
    <h1>Q. Can we organize the content differently?</h1>
    <p>A. Yes, but let's decide on a structure and then stick with it. Once decided, we'll share with the other programmers.</p>
    
    <h1>Q. Why have this at all?</h1>
    <p>A. Because there are a lot of programmer tools floating around but poor visibility and no central repository</p>
    
    <h1>Q. Who has access to this content?</h1>
    <p>A. It's public, so be smart about what you put in here</p>
    
    <h1>Q. Who is liable if something bad happens as a result of using this stuff?</h1>
    <p>A. According to the MIT License, the user. Still, we should carefully review anything that gets contributed</p>
    
    <h1>Q. How do I use stuff that's contributed by others?</h1>
    <p>A. My current approach is to clone the repo to a subdirectory under my $HOME on Ares, then link to the scripts I want to use in my $HOME/bin</p>
